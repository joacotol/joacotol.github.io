      <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
      <p>
        I am writing to apply for a position as
        <span class="position">a position</span> at
        <span id="company">Company</span>, currently advertised at
        <span id="agency">Agency</span>. I have great customer service
        experience that I have honed working in a cafe/deli for more than a year
        as an all rounder. At the same time, having experience on serving
        customers sandwiches or other hot deli items. I also worked in a
        fast-paced restaurant as a kitchen hand so I’m able to work in a
        high-stress environment, able to focus on the task at hand and helping
        customers. I believe that with my skills I can help the company increase
        sales and improve customer relations that will entice them to come back
        for more.
      </p>

      <p>
        My availability is flexible so I can work on any days given to me, and
        my preferred number of hours to work per week is 20+hours/week or more
        depending on the business needs. I'm on a working holiday visa from
        Canada and I just arrived here this June.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have enclosed my resume to support my application, which shows key
        skills that will be important for the position as
        <span class="position">a position</span>. I would like to work in your
        establishment because I’m confident that I can make the venue a warm,
        welcoming place for customers to relax, and enjoy some great tasting
        food and beverages. As well as be able to continue to improve myself and
        learn more about the industry from professionals working there.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would be more than happy to talk to you about this position, and how I
        could be a great candidate for the role as
        <span class="position">a position</span>. Thank you for considering my
        application. I look forward to hearing from you.
      </p>
